# Landscape classification

## Overview

This is an image classification app that uses a CNN to classify images of landscapes into 5 different categories: "Coast", "Desert", "Forest", "Glacier" and "Mountain". The model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 images from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/landscape-recognition-image-dataset-12k-images?datasetId=2707450&sortBy=voteCount).
